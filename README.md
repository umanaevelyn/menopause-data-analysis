Exploratory data analysis of open datasets related to menopause, symptoms and health impact using Python.
# Menopause Data Analysis

This project explores open datasets related to **menopause** and its impact on women's health.  
The goal is to apply **Data Science techniques** (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to identify patterns in symptoms, treatments, and quality of life.  

## 📊 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on menopause-related datasets.
- Visualize prevalence of symptoms such as hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood changes, etc.
- Explore potential associations between lifestyle, age, and health outcomes.
- Create reproducible notebooks to share insights with the scientific and data science community.

## 🗂️ Repository structure
